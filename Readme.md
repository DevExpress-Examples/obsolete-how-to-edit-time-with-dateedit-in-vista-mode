â›” DEPRECATED. This example demonstrates how to display a calendar and time picker in the [DateEdit](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Editors.DateEdit) popup. Starting from v19.2, you can use the [DateEditNavigatorWithTimePickerStyleSettings](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Editors.DateEditNavigatorWithTimePickerStyleSettings) object instead. Refer to the following help topics for more information:

- [DateEditNavigatorWithTimePickerStyleSettings](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/DevExpress.Xpf.Editors.DateEditNavigatorWithTimePickerStyleSettings)
- [DateEdit Operation Modes](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/116793/controls-and-libraries/data-editors/common-features/editor-operation-modes/dateedit)

The current approach will not be updated in the future.
